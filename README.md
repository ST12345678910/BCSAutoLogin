## Installation
To install, <code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>. The user will also have to place an [An OS Compatible ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=100.0.4896.60/) into the root directory so that the script can open Chrome on your device. If the user does not want to install requirements globally, they can create a virtual environment.
## Usage
 Firstly, replace the placeholders in the script with your username and password. Run <code>python3 BCSAutoLogin</code>, then wait until the time specified. You can also remove the bottom schedule and replace it with the function end, this way the script can be run manually.
